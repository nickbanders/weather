# Weather Project
A project that enables the user to search the weather in any location and have that search saved. I was able to acheive this by utlizing an API for both current day and 5-day forecast. I used a mixture of Bootstrap and vanilla CSS for my layout, while using javascript to dynmically create the weather report and search history buttons.
